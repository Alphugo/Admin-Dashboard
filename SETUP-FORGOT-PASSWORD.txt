========================================
âœ… FORGOT PASSWORD FEATURE ADDED!
========================================

I've successfully added the forgot password feature 
with 6-digit OTP email verification!

WHAT WAS ADDED:
========================================
âœ… "Forgot Password?" link on login page
âœ… Forgot password form (enter email)
âœ… OTP verification form (enter 6-digit code)
âœ… Reset password form (set new password)
âœ… Email with OTP code
âœ… Automatic email sending

STEP 1: Create OTP Table in Supabase
========================================
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com
2. Click: "SQL Editor" â†’ "New query"
3. Open file: FORGOT-PASSWORD-SQL.sql
4. Copy ALL the SQL code
5. Paste in Supabase and click "Run"
6. You should see "OTP table created successfully!"

STEP 2: Restart Your Server
========================================
The server will restart automatically with the new features.

STEP 3: Test It!
========================================
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Forgot Password?" link
3. Enter your registered email
4. Check your email for the 6-digit code
5. Enter the code to verify
6. Set your new password
7. Login with new password!

HOW IT WORKS:
========================================
1. User clicks "Forgot Password?"
2. Enters email and clicks "Send OTP"
3. System generates random 6-digit code
4. Code is emailed to user
5. Code expires in 15 minutes
6. User enters code to verify
7. User sets new password
8. User can now login

SECURITY:
========================================
âœ… OTP expires in 15 minutes
âœ… Each OTP can only be used once
âœ… Email validation
âœ… Password strength validation
âœ… Secure password hashing

========================================
READY TO USE! ðŸŽ‰
