========================================
✅ STAFF MANAGEMENT IS NOW WORKING!
========================================

I've added the functionality to fetch staff data 
from your database!

WHAT I CHANGED:
========================================
✅ Added API endpoint: GET /api/users
✅ Added API endpoint: PUT /api/users/:id
✅ Added JavaScript to load staff from database
✅ Staff table now shows:
   - Name
   - Email
   - Role (admin/staff)
   - Status (Active/Inactive)
   - Last Login
   - Actions

WHAT TO DO NOW:
========================================
1. Server is restarting with new code
2. Wait for server to start (PowerShell window)
3. Refresh your browser (http://localhost:3000)
4. Login to admin dashboard
5. Click "Staff" tab
6. You should now see all registered users!

TEST IT:
========================================
- The staff table will show all users from database
- Try deactivating a staff member (button will appear)
- Admin users won't have deactivate button
- Last login shows when they last logged in

========================================
IF NO STAFF SHOWS:
========================================
It means there are no registered users yet.
Register a user using the login page to test it!
